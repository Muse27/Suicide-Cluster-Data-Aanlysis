## Dataset
I have used the dataset from kaggle whose Link is: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szamil/who-suicide-statistics

After cleaning the dataset I exported it as 
[suicide_output.csv](https://github.com/Muse27/Suicide-Cluster-Data-Aanlysis/files/12383914/suicide_output.csv)

## Data Wrangling
It is done to understand the dataset a bit better from its raw form. Data wrangling is the process of removing errors and combining complex data sets to make them more accessible and easier to analyze. A data wrangling process, also known as a data munging process, consists of reorganizing, transforming and mapping data from one "raw" form into another in order to make it more usable and valuable for a variety of downstream uses including analytics.

## Exploratory Data Ananlysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analytics process to understand the data in depth and learn the different data characteristics, often with visual means. This allows you to get a better feel of your data and find useful patterns in it.
It is crucial to understand it in depth before you perform data analysis and run your data through an algorithm.

### I have tried answering the following questions in my way:
Q: Which year has the most suicides?
Q: Which year has the least suicides? 
Q: Which country has the most suicides? 
Q: Which country has the least suicides? 
Q: Are certain age groups more inclined to suicide? 
Q: What is the relationship between gender and the number of suicides?

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is a field in data analysis that deals with visual representation of data. It graphically plots data and is an effective way to communicate inferences from data. With pictures, maps and graphs, the human mind has an easier time processing and understanding any given data.

I have used matplotlib & seaborn libraries of Python to generate presentable data insights.
Along with this I have also made a [Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/Muse27/Suicide-Cluster-Data-Aanlysis/files/12383934/global.suicide.rate.pdf)
 for the clean dataset.
